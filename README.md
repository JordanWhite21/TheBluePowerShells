## Overview
Welcome to the Blue Powershells GitHub! Have you ever played Mario Kart on the go before? If your answer is yes you probably played Mario Kart Tour and wondered which Characters would be the best performing characters on particular courses. Our project seeks to do just that; Based on user input would we be able to predict whether or not a custom made character would win on a course. 

## Data Cleaning
In our github you will find various information related to our project. First is the DataCleaning folder that contains all of the information on how we cleaned our data. Their were two main components to our api - (Insert link to API) that we used for this analysis. The first was Driver data containing information about driver names, uniqueids, special skills, and rarities amongst other data about character looks that would be thrown out for this analysis. Next we had the courses component, which contained each course used throughout the game, as well as the top drivers on that course, contained in a dictionary of lists. Eventually this would result in a total of 5 new csvs that would be loaded into our Resources folder.
